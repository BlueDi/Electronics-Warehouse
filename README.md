# LDSOt4g3 - Electronics Warehouse System for Universities
[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)


Electronics warehouses are specific because of the diversity of request to be kept: external purchase orders, small components reusable or not, large list of similar components that might be under stock, etc. 

Cost management, bulk purchase orders and diversity of stackeholders also amount to the complexity of the system. 

The system would ideally communicate via B2B standard protocols with large suppliers, compare prices and suggest components in stock to answer customer requests. 

Workflow configuration and shibboleth UP integration should integrate easily for a comfortable user experience for students, professors, financial managers and warehouse workers.
